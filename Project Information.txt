OBJECTIVE

The objective of this machine learning project is to predict the category a mail falls into.
These categories include:
Ham and Spam messages

This project represent my first trial at Natural Language Processing (NLP). it is therefore also meant 
to acquaint with me various text processing and NLP techniques.


CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS:

The criteria for the success of this project would be an achievement of an 
accuracy of above 90 percent. This in itself is not a complete measure of the prediction powers
of a model. The precision of the model i.e how good it is at positive predictions and in this case 
the ham messages would also be considered

The CRISP-DM methodology which is an industry accepted data science methodology 
would be used. Major phases of this methodology include:   
	Business Understanding - 
	Data Understanding - 
	Data Preparation - 
	Modeling - 
	Evaluation - 
	Deployment

RESULTS:

A logistic regression and a random forest algorithm was used.

1. The binary logistic algorithm produced a model that had an accuracy score of
   94.9 percent.  

2. The naive bayes classifier on the other hand produced a model which had an 
   accuracy of 95.5 percent. 
   
CONCLUSION:

The naive bayes classifier seems a slighty better fit and would be used.
