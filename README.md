## Spam Classifier

The aim and objective of this machine learning project is to create a model which is capable of predicting the category in which a mail falls into.
These categories include:
Ham and Spam messages

This project represent my first trial at Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is thus meant to help me get acquainted with me various text processing as well as other techniques which are used in Natural langauge Processing ptojects.

RESULTS:

A logistic regression and a random forest algorithm were used.

1. The binary logistic algorithm produced a model that had an accuracy score of
   94.9 percent.  

2. The naive bayes classifier on the other hand produced a model which had an 
   accuracy of 95.5 percent. 
   
CONCLUSION:

The naive bayes classifier seems a slighty better fit and would be used.
